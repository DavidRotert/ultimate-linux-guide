# What in the world is this about?

This guide will cover the start into the Linux operating system as an alternative for Windows and macOS. It's goal ist to make the life easier for the ones who are not computer enthusiasts but want to learn something new. Or maybe the ones who thought about switching away from Windows or macOS for different reasons. Whatever brings you here, this book will be the right start for you.

## 1. Okay, tell me - what is this "Linux" thing?

In short terms, Linux is an operating system.

Okay, well, maybe this doesn't sound familiar to your. Then let me explain what an operating system is. An operating system is basically a software plus a collection of different other software. Back in the days when computers were not as powerfull as today, computers did'nt need shuch kind of software to operate. Every piece if software was directly executet at the start and even today this technically could be possible. But things got complicated over the years. Today, computers are much more complex, need to talk to periphirals linke USB sticks, webcams, printers, hell, even the graphics card to play your favorite games is so complex!

This is where the operating system (or just short: OS) comes in. Maybe you know Windows, macOS or Android and iOS from your smarthpones. Guess what - these all are different operating systems. It is responsible for starting other programs like your web browser, your apps, your favorite games and every other program. It also handles communication with hardware components, contains and manages drivers for the WiFi chips and the graphics card. Manages the memory (RAM) on the computer. Contains software for you to do the work you want to do.

And Linux? Where comes Linux in? Well, Linux is just another one OS, an alternative for Windows and macOS (and many, many, many, many many more even I have never heard of ... but this is a topic for another day and another guide). Linux mostly can be used in the same way but has some advantages and disadvantages I will cover in the next headings of this chapter. It is different than what you maybe know - maybe in good, maybe in bad meanings. But just be patient and don't worry. We will cover everything you need to know. Everything new is strange and complicated at first, but with a little bit of time learning the new thing it doesn't scare you any more.

### But ... why did someone say "It's called GNU/Linux!" (a not really that important fun fact)

Remember I said Linux was an operating system? Well, technically - this isn't true. Linux itself is just a kernel, a software, that is the heart of an operating system. On Windows the kernel is called NT for example. In this book, what we are referring to as Linux, is in fact (mostly) GNU/Linux. It is a type of operating system built on top of the Linux kernel and the GNU tools as a basic set of software and some other ones like your desktop and so on. But most people don't treat this naming as a religion - and we don't do this, too. So I will only call it "Linux" instead of "GNU/Linux".

## 2. Why should I get started into learning and using Linux?

I could give you a short answer: Why not? But ... I think you wanted a better answer than that.

Okay, so to anser why **you** should dive into learning Linux, we will first look at where it is mostly used. On your normal day to day computer, Linux is not really popular as an operating system. But did you know? Most of the internet in fact is driven by Linux servers. Yes, you heard right! Most servers on the web run Linux! Isn't that impressive? Linux mostly setteled in the server space because it is developed by an Open Source community, it is very stable and has many features which suits this work environment very well. But of course this doesn't mean you can't run a web browser on Linux and use it on your computer! Linux is a multi purpose operating system which covers many use cases. But, the server use case maybe even is important for you. Maybe you are dreaming about working as a programmer or system administrator in an IT company (or an IT department of a company)? Well, then this guide is a good opportunity for you. If you learn the basics of Linux today, you will know what to expect if you have to manage a server in the future.

But maybe you are just someone who wants to know more about computers? Maybe you want to tinker around and learn how everything works? Then Linux is perfect for you, too. In fact, Linux systems aren't as closed down as for example macOS and Windows. On Linux, things just work different and are mostly community driven. You read that I said it's Open Source? This means, that developers from all over the world contribute to the project as a hobby or because they were hired to do so from a company which runs Linux on their infrastructure. And they offer this work for free! Yes, unlike with Windows or macOS, you don't pay an organization for a license (or buy their expensive hardware just to run their software). Pretty cool, huh? And this approach also means that everyone can get the program source code for Linux, modify it, customize it, improve it, test it ... This is just ideal for tinkering because you can read hat your OS does. And this also has some benefits in form of security because bugs and security issues can be found faster than on closed source systems like Windows or macOS (okay, this is a pretty controversial topic nobody knows the real answer to. Please don't expect a fully unbiased opinion from me on this security aspect.)

But what about the ones who just want to use Linux without learning how computers work? The ones who only need a web browser and mail client, a cheap computer for school? Or the not so enthusiastic users who do some photo/video editing or gaming? Well, if you don't mind with **some** learning and tinkering you definitely **can** use Linux as a free replacement for Windows or macOS. But if some learning is too much for you or one of the disadvantages in the next paragraph makes you worry, you should better stick to what you know. Things **can** work out well for you, sure. But Linux sometimes **needs** some knowledge if you need to solve a problem.

### Here is the **TL;DR** list:
- It is free and Open Source so anyone can modify or look up things in the program (of course with programming and other computer knowledge)
- It is ideal for tinkering and customizing
- It teaches you much more about how computers work
- Because it is Open Source, it does not (or pretty unlikely) spy on you like Microsoft or other companies tend to do these days
- It is more secure (controversial, but I will still keep this one as an argument)
- It is used on servers (mostly important for you if you want to become a system administrator)

## 3. Why should I **NOT**  learn Linux?


Also, if you rely on some special software like the Microsoft Office suite, Photoshop or some special video editing software and games ... stick with Windows or macOS as your day to day computer and
