# Welcome to the ultimate Linux guide!

Hello and welcome to the ultimate Linux guide.

## The beginners guide

The beginners guide covers all topics to get started into the world of the Linux operating system and even computers in general. If you even don't know what the heck Linux is - don't worry, we are working in small steps. Just start reading [with the first chapter (or even better called chapter 0)](Beginners%20guide/Chapter%200%20-%20Introduction.md).
